# DDIMeta.jl

This is very rough code for parsing dataset metadata. It's mainly been for internal use

There is code for:

* loading DDI xml files
* loading from an earlier version which parses UKDS documentation files
* see [ ] for parsing code for UKDS (Ruby).

TODO

* fuller docs;
* better (any!) test suite;
*  fix the TODOs.
